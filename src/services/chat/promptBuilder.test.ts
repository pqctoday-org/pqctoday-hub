// The local (WebLLM) prompt is a token-budget-constrained condensation of

// constraint category the Gemini prompt enumerates individually needs to
// survive that condensation in at least a compact form, on the provider
// already documented (WebLLMService.ts, ProviderSetup.tsx) as more prone to
// hallucinate. These tests pin the categories a 2026-08-18 audit found had
// been silently dropped rather than compacted: certification-status claims,
// product-algorithm-support claims, and source-specific (not generic) hedging.
